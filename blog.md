# Computer Vision Tools

_There are two types of people in this world.
    1.  Those who finish what they start._

## Goals

Hello, and welcome to Computer Vision Tools, my blog documenting my attempts to solve some real-world problems using
  Numpy, OpenCV, Scikit and whatever other python libaries prove usefull down the road.
I have been meaning to start a computer vision blog for some time.
Not because I am a an expert on the subject, (Spoiler alert: I am not) but it is a subject I really enjoy and would like to learn better.
They say the best way to learn something is to try to explain it to someone else.  Well you are that someone else.

I do have a few goals for this blog.

  1. To build some _useful_ computer vision tools.
  2. To use real-world inputs.
  3. To write high quality Python 3 code.

### Tools

A lot of the computer vision code I have read has been short snippets of code demonstrating how to use one or two new functions.  
While this is certainly helpful for learning how those functions work, I want to challenge us to build useful tools and not just demos.
A useful tools doesn't have to be anything elaborate - a useful tools is something solves a problem well enough that you remember to pull it out the next time the problem comes up.
This has several implications:

  1. It works
  2. It is flexible - if I have to
  3. It is easy to use - if I have to type 500 characters of command line arguments to run a script, I am not going to bother running that script.
  4. It is easy to understand - if I have to read through the source code to figure out how to run the xyx.py script - or even worse, figure out what it does, I am not going to bother running that script.

### Inputs

Another frustation I have had with computer vision code is that it works great on the pristine images the author provides,
but when I try to use it one the picture I took with the poor lighting or my jittery video, it doesn't work nearly as well.
 pictures and and videos collected from cameras and not pristine images from a website.

### Python

Most of my experience with Python has been with Python 2.  
As Python 2 is now ending the end of its life, it is time to bite the bullet and embrace Python 3.
